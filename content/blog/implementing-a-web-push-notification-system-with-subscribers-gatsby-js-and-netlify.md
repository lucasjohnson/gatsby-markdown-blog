Web Push notifications are content messages that are sent to a device by a web application or website. These Web Push notifications can only be sent to site visitors who have opted-in to receive such notifications from a particular website or web application. This opt-in for Web Push notifications usually occurs by a visitor visiting a site and being presented with a Web Push notification that asks if that visitor would like to receive updates from that website. If a user accepts or says yes, then that visitor subscribes to these updates.

On this tutorial, I am just going to show how to implement a web push notifications system using Subscribers and a Gatsby JS site. If you are interested in knowing more about Web Push Notifications and how you can leverage its full power, I recommend you this[awesome guide](https://blog.subscribers.com/web-push-notifications-the-ultimate-guide?utm_source=juvasoft.com&utm_campaign=implementing+push+notifications+using+subscribers+and+gatsbyjs)that covers pretty much everything about it.
