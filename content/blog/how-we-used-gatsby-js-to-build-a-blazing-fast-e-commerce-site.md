[Flamingo](https://www.shopflamingo.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=eng-blog&utm_content=architecture)has landed, Flamingo’s xxx parent company, serves over one million female customers. We believe that women deserve high-quality, reasonably priced, and simple body care products too.

As an engineering team, we are committed to providing women with a body care experience tailored to their specific needs. It’s important to us that our customers enjoy their interactions with us not only while they’re in the shower, but also when they shop for their blades, wax kits, or razor handles online too.

To simplify shopping for razors we built a performant, visually-appealing, and secure site. Our architecture performs well across browsers and devices, emphasizes developer ergonomics and modern tools, and lets us continuously deploy with confidence. We think[shopflamingo.com](https://www.shopflamingo.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=eng-blog&utm_content=architecture)can be a model for how to architect other e-commerce sites.
